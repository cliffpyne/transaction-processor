Bank statement transaction processor with Google Sheets integration.

## Features
- Process Excel (.xlsx) and PDF bank statements
- Extract customer information (phone numbers, plate numbers)

## File Limits (Free Tier)
- **PDF Files**: Maximum 50 pages or 3MB

## Troubleshooting

### "Worker timeout" errors
- PDF is too large (>50 pages)
- Split PDF or use Excel format

### "Out of memory" errors
- Free tier RAM limit reached
- Reduce PDF size or upgrade plan

### Processing too slow
- PDFs are inherently slow to process
- Use Excel format for faster processing
- Consider upgrading to paid plan for larger files
